# speed-dating
A capstone project for my master's degree at UCLA. Uses dataset from Kaggle.

This dataset was compiled by Columbia Business School professors Ray Fisman and Sheena Iyengar for their paper Gender Differences in Mate Selection: Evidence From a Speed Dating Experiment.
Data was gathered from participants in experimental speed dating events from 2002-2004. During the events, the attendees would have a four minute "first date" with every other participant of the opposite sex. At the end of their four minutes, participants were asked if they would like to see their date again. They were also asked to rate their date on six attributes: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests.
Size of dataset: 8378 rows, ~40 columns in interest, including gender, order, match, field, career, life habits and six important attributes, etc.

Questions to answer (project scope):
1. If both choose to date again (a match), what are the most important attributes? 
2. Predict whether a pair of participants will produce a match.
3. Compare predicted results given by our model with real matching results; Compare predicted results given by participants (derived attribute from their prediction and their decisions) with real matching results. 
4. Are the most important features the same with what they claim to be the most important features? 
(5. Recommend participants who may very likely to be their matches.)
